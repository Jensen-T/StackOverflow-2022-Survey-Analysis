# StackOverflow-2022-Survey-Analysis

Still a work in Progress! <br>

This project aims to utilise the StackOverflow 2022 Developer survey to discover some potential insights and analysis that can be found. <br>

<ul> <strong><h3>Some questions I seek to answer: </h3></strong></ul>
<li> What are the distribution of workers between Remote, Office and Hybrid? </li>
<li> What is the most popular method of learning to code?</li>
<li> Does coding experience affect the level of pay that developers receive?</li>
